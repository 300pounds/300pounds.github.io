title: Let's Take The Plunge

I, along with 2 others, have decided to enter the <a title="Rally Website" href="http://www.wackyrally.co.uk"><strong>Barmy to Barcelona</strong> </a>2014, banger rally.


Basically the premise is that we buy a car, worth approximately £300, and travel across the Europe to Barcelona.
Along the way we'll complete challenges, have parties and hopefully not <strong><a title="Charity Sweepstake" href="">break down</a></strong>.

Today we finally took the plunge and payed the entry fee, so we <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sorry" title="Sorry ">rally</a> are doing this.

Wish us luck*

Lou
