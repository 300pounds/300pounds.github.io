# My Projects

I have many projects on the go at [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/iwillspeak) and [Github](http://github.com/iwillspeak); most of them are just for fun. Here are some of the jewels in the crown:

* [Snooper](http://github.com/iwillspeak/snooper) - Spying on your files and running your tests.
* [Parsegen](http://github.com/iwillspeak/Parsegen) - Transform grammar files into working top-down parsers.
* [Thunker](https://vimeo.com/66365606) - Home automation at its finest.
