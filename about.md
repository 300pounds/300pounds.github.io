# About Will Speak

I am a computer science student and software developer. I have just finished my degree and am off into the world. I have an interest in [photography][flickr] and a weakness for all things mac.

You can usually find me messing around with some form of software or another, and this has lead to the creation of many [projects]({{site.url}}/projects.html). When I have the time, or feel the need, I like to post my thoughts on my [Blog][blog].

You can follow me on Twitter as [@willspeak][twitter]. Don't expect me to tell you anything more interesting than the coffee i'm drinking though.
